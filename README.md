# Hiya

I'm Paige.

## Here are some of my cooler projects:
- [AdHoc Launch](https://github.com/qanazoga/AdHocLaunch) - Uses `netsh` to create private Wi-Fi networks (which is now a default capability of Windows 10)
- [SkyGuard](https://github.com/qanazoga/SkyGuard) - Made in 48 hours for a final project shortly after I had brain surgery. Turned out great!
- [My Cookbook](https://qanazoga.com/recipe) - A collection of recipes I make often. Programming isn't the only thing I do ;)
- [big-brain.js](https://github.com/qanazoga/big-brain.js) - A JavaScript library to add the little things I miss from Python
- [Soturi](https://github.com/qanazoga/soturi), [Hallita](https://github.com/qanazoga/hallita), and [Carlisle](https://github.com/qanazoga/carlisle) - Discord bots I've written to learn Python, JavaScript, and Clojure respectively  

If you need help with something I've made please submit a PR or issue, or email me at qanazoga@gmail.com
