# Hiya

I'm Paige.

## Here are some of my cooler projects:
- [AdHoc Launch](https://github.com/qanazoga/AdHocLaunch) - Uses `netsh` to create private Wi-Fi networks (which is now a default capability of Windows 10)
- [SkyGuard](https://github.com/qanazoga/SkyGuard) - Made in 48 hours for a final project shortly after I had brain surgery. Turned out great!
- [qanazoga.com](https://qanazoga.com) - My website. A comfy place that I'm always trying to improve. Also goes more in depth on some projects.

If you need help with something submit a PR or issue, or email me at qanazoga@gmail.com
